<h2>About this ISP Session demo</h2>
<div class="well">
The session is managed using the ADC Cure ASP Session Replacement called ISP Session!<br/>
    This demo also shows some of the supported different types of OLE automation variables which do exist, such as (VB naming) Boolean, Byte, Integer, Long, Currency, Variant, Variant Array, Date, String, Double, Single, and persistable Objects (such as ADODB.Recordset)<br />
    In addition, it supports the 8-byte integer, officially also supported OLE Automation, but not officially by VB Script<br />

    <h2>ISP Session does not support .NET compatibility</h2>
    <p>
        In theory, it is possible to run ISP Session, which is an unmanaged classic COM object, in co-operation with .NET aspx pages. However, in testing situations, even using all possible options such aspcompat=true.<br />
        This was not a reliable and stable solution.
