# Project Archived

This project has been **archived**, and we encourage customers to upgrade to the new version at [ISP Session Core](https://github.com/egbertn/ispsession.core).

![Archived](https://example.com/archive-image.png)

The new product is compatible with **.NET6** (and higher) and is currently designed to work with **Redis** and **Stack Exchange**.

Key Features:
- **Full encryption** and **compression**
- Minimal impact on the **.NET runtime**
- Supports **cookie-based session state**, custom headers, remote IP, or even deep inspection of a request body to base a session token.

This last option is ideal for integration with **webhooks**, where no browser is involved, but a 'session state' is still required.

This example project shows some ways to deal with sessions or application states or both.
