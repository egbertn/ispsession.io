ISP Session 8.0 will not have an MSI setup (previous did).
To get ISP Session running do the following:

1. 	Download the DEMO application http://ispsession.io/download/?file=ispsessiondemo (not yet available)
	this includes classic asp & Asp.Net classic
	(Hybrid solution, yes)
2. 	The Demo contains a valid web.Config
    	that ISP Session COM (classic asp) will read.
3. 	Modify your website in order it includes or has 
    	Server.CreateObject("NWCTools.CSession"). The demo has a simple sample.
4.	Disable the integrated IIS 6+ session state. This can be done on the inetmgr.exe, configuring the website that you want to test.
	Or else, use the page level meta <%@enablesessionstate=false %>	
4. 	Install Redis. 
	Dowload it from ispsession.io/download/?file=redis (not yet available at time of writing)
5. 	Configure Redis datasource in Web.config
6. 	Create a folder, e.g. c:\IISTools\
	Copy the files from the zip into it.
7.	Run RegisterCOM.vbs from a command prompt.
	It will register the Dll's and eventually dowload and install the VC 12 runtime.

your site should be working now.

Purchasing
	Chose your license.
	Enumerate all the domains that will use ISP Session. E.g. an active directory domain where you develop, e.g. applepie.local, would be sufficient.
		Since many Web Servers are not domain members anymore, include the workgroup names or server names.
		These names will be used for generating the license.
	Just sent me an email at egbertDOTnieropATadccureDOTnl
	I will sent you a paypal request.
	The unlocked dlls will come your way, including the license. 
	Just copy the dll's over the existing ones. No registration using regsvr32 is required.
	The license must be applied to web.Config using the appKey settings "License" and "Csession.LIC"
		eg:
   		 <add key="ispsession_io:Csession.LIC" value="mydomain.local"/>
    		<add key="ispsession_io:License" value="F01FB5D0BCA6CE4C8CC773916F281C32"/>
		note: Each name must be separated by a \r\n (CR+LF), which in XML is &#xD;&#xA;
