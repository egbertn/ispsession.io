These samples, are not compiled. Make sure you compile them first.
In addition, you need the following package from Nuget "StackExchange.Redis.StrongName" version 1.2.6.
Also, you need Redis either on Windows, which is an old Redis build 3.0.
We have included a Redis executable which runs as a service on Windows.
Microsoft now also supports Linux Bash on Windows 10 anniversary update, 
so you could run Redis server (say version 4.0) for Linux on Windows as well.
ISP Session cannot yet connect to Redis on Microsoft Azure.

Install the demo website e.g. on IIS on 
http://localhost/CookieWeb

and if you want to test ASP.NET Core with ISP Session
http://localhost/CookieWebCore

In web.Config you have to modify the mailSettings tag in order to have the resume demo working.
For resume.asp, do the same. 

Now, for CookieWeb you have 3 entry points.
1) http://localhost/CookieWeb/default.asp 
	(testing classic ASP)
2) http://localhost/CookieWeb/default.aspx
	(testing ASP.NET Classic)
3) http://localhost/CookieWeb/home/default 
	(testing MVC 5.2)


If you switch pages, say, from asp to aspx, you should see that all session variables are maintained.

The same applies to CookieWebCore, since ASP.NET core is self-hosting, it will not allow hybrid configurations (asp/asp.net etc)
	You should configure an ASP.NET Core app on a different virtual app.

Make sure that the ispsession_io:AD_PATH variable, which is the CookiePath, equals '/'. Otherwise, 
	the session cannot be shared among those paths.
